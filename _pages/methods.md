# World Generation with Simplex Noise
---
We used the [Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise) to generate a wide variety of challenging worlds for our robots.

* TODO add the math
* TODO add example images
* TODO comparison to box worlds [ablation study]


# World Encoding with Fixed Basis Set
---
We adopted the idea of a fixed basis set from computer vision [cite] and applied it to robotic motion planning.
