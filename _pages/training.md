# Network based Iterative Dataset Generation
---
We train the networks supervised and used the MSE as loss.

This is the general flow of information through the network.
The network architecture consists only of fully connected layers and skip connections.

In the next section we provide the detailed number weights for each robot.
In 2D we used a set size of 256 for the fixed basis, in 3D we used 2144.
Furthermore, we scaled the networks roughly with the degrees of freedom of the corresponding robot.
